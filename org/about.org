#+TITLE: About

* About this website
This is my personal website. Here, you should expect to find random
blog posts about pretty much anything, most likely tech or science, as
well as pictures of mountains and nature. 

The main goal of this website is to provide me an alternative to
social networks, completely free and extensible. 

This website has been built with org-mode, you can find the source
code on github, and a detailed explanation of my (WIP) setup here TODO
add link.
