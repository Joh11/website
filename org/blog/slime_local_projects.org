#+TITLE: SLIME : displaying quicklisp local-projects
#+DATE: <2020-07-31 ven.>
#+DESCRIPTION: 

* Problem
In the SLIME REPL, whenever the =,load-system= command is used, the
ASDF systems located in the =~/quicklisp/local-projects/= directory
are not displaid in the auto-completion list. However, they are indeed
there, as typing their full name loads them perfectly. 

This is due to the fact that to register these systems, Quicklisp uses
the =asdf:*system-definition-search-functions*= mechanism, which
locates the systems as it is asked, and is thus unable to output a
list of available systems.

* Solution
Fortunately, the fix for this is easy: use another method to register
the local-projects directory, that is using the source registry (see
the related [[https://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/asdf.html#Configuring-ASDF][ASDF manual page]]). 

To do so, create a file
=~/.config/common-lisp/source-registry.conf.d/quicklisp-local-projects.conf=
with the following content:
#+begin_src lisp
  (:tree "~/quicklisp/local-projects/")
#+end_src
