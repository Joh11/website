* Introduction

* Goals
- Having a nice and beautiful static website
- Use only org-mode to write new posts
- Ability to show equations
- Ability to show (and color highlight ?) code

* State of the project

* Test of equations in Mathjax
Inline equation test : \(i\hbar\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} =  \hat H  \psi\)
And display equation test : 

\begin{equation*}
i\hbar\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} =  \hat H  \psi\
\end{equation*}
